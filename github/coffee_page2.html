<h1>Brewing</h1>
<p>The roasted coffee beans may be ground at a roastery, in a grocery store, 
or in the home. Most coffee is roasted and ground at a roastery and sold in
packaged form, though roasted coffee beans can be ground at home immediate
-ly before consumption. It is also possible, though uncommon, to roast raw
beans at home.</p>

<p>Coffee beans may be ground in various ways. A burr grinder uses revolving 
elements to shear the seed; a blade grinder cuts the seeds with blades 
moving at high speed; and a mortar and pestle crushes the seeds. For most 
brewing methods a burr grinder is deemed superior because the grind is 
more even and the grind size can be adjusted.</p>

<h3 id = "drip-filtration">Drip filtration</h3>
<p>this is your standard auto-drip machine or the manual pourover method. 
You pass hot water over ground coffee (remember freshly ground is highly
recommended) and there’s a paper filter that catches oils and sediments.
The coffee drips through and voila, you have your brew! Auto-drip is by 
far the most common method used in most homes, while manual pour-over 
has regained popularity with recent coffee connoisseurs because it offers
better control over brewing.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id = "steeping">Steeping</h3>
<p>This technique involves the ground coffee having constant contact with 
hot or cold water for a certain amount of time, extracting the flavors 
from coffee into the water. Filtration happens in one go at the end. 
French press, aeropress and toddy brewing system are all examples of this
method.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id = "pressurized-infusion">pressurized infusion</h3>
<p>a long time ago, the Italians who wanted their coffee quick, invented the
method of using pressure.This led to the invention of the espresso techn-
ique, the espresso shot and all the derived types of drinks using espres-
so shots. The way this works is that you shoot water under pressure 
through finely ground and tightly packed ground coffee, and what comes 
through is a small shot-sized piece of goodness on the other end.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id = "vacuum-filtration">Vacuum filtration</h3>
<p>this is the siphon and other funky-looking but also very finicky methods 
in some cafes. I’ve only tried coffee from this system once, and wasn’t 
impressed for the amount of work that goes into this.This is best viewed
in a display case since it looks so cool.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id = "Decalktion">Decalktion</h3>
<p>also famously known as cowboy coffee. Turkish coffee is also made in 
this way (in a device with a long handle called ibrik). The idea is that
you are boiling water with coffee above it and as the water comes to 
boil,it extracts from the coffee above it.This coffee is generally consi
-dered to the strong, although that’s generally a misrepresentation for 
bitter due to overextraction.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id = "Percolation">Percolation</h3>
<p>the last method is percolation where the water is boiling through finely
ground coffee and collecting as coffee above it. Stovetop coffee makers
and mokapots are examples of this technique. Keep in mind that this 
industry is getting a lot of attention and there will likely be more and
more innovation in brewing methods over the next few years. This list 
will hopefully expand (I’ll update it as I learn more) and hopefully it 
will lead to better-tasting coffee.</p>
