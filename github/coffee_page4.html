<p>Roasting coffee transforms the chemical and physical properties of green 
coffee beans into roasted coffee products. The roasting process is what 
produces the characteristic flavor of coffee by causing the green coffee 
beans to change in taste. Unroasted beans contain similar if not higher 
levels of acids, protein, sugars, and caffeine as those that have been 
roasted, but lack the taste of roasted coffee beans due to the Maillard 
and other chemical reactions that occur during roasting.</P>

<p>The vast majority of coffee is roasted commercially on a large scale,but
small-scale commercial roasting has grown significantly with the trend 
toward "single-origin" coffees served at specialty shops. Some coffee drink-
ers even roast coffee at home as a hobby in order to both experiment with 
the flavor profile of the beans and ensure the freshest possible roast.</P>

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>During the roasting process, coffee beans tend to go through a weight loss
of about 15 to 18% due to the loss of water and volatile compounds. Although
the beans experience a weight loss, the size of the beans double after 
the roasting process due to the physical expansion of the cellulose 
structure which facilitates the release of carbon dioxide, volatile 
organic compounds, and water (in the form of steam)</p>

<h3>Equipment</h3>
<p>The most common roasting machines are of two basic types: drum and 
hot-air, although there are others including packed-bed, tangential and 
centrifugal roasters. Roasters can operate in either batch or continuous
 modes. Home roasters are also available.</p>
 
<p>Fluid bed or hot-air roasters force heated air through a screen or 
perforated plate under the coffee beans with sufficient force to lift the
beans. Heat is transferred to the beans as they tumble and circulate within
this fluidized bed.</p>
